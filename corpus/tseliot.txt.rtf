\f0\fs24 \cf0 Gerontion\
 Thou hast nor youth nor age\
 But as it were an after dinner sleep\
 Dreaming of both.\
Here I am, an old man in a dry month,\
Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain.\
I was neither at the hot gates\
Nor fought in the warm rain\
Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,\
Bitten by flies, fought.\
My house is a decayed house,\
And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner,\
Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp,\
Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London.\
The goat coughs at night in the field overhead;\
Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.\
The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,\
Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.\
 I an old man,\
A dull head among windy spaces.\
Signs are taken for wonders. \'93We would see a sign\'94:\
The word within a word, unable to speak a word,\
Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the year\
Came Christ the tiger\
In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,\
To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk\
Among whispers; by Mr. Silvero\
With caressing hands, at Limoges\
Who walked all night in the next room;\
By Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;\
By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room\
Shifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp\
Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles\
Weave the wind. I have no ghosts,\
An old man in a draughty house\
Under a windy knob.\
After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now\
History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors\
And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,\
Guides us by vanities. Think now\
She gives when our attention is distracted\
And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions\
That the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late\
What\'92s not believed in, or if still believed,5\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
In memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon\
Into weak hands, what\'92s thought can be dispensed with\
Till the refusal propagates a fear. Think\
Neither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices\
Are fathered by our heroism. Virtues\
Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes.\
These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.\
The tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last\
We have not reached conclusion, when I\
Stiffen in a rented house. Think at last\
I have not made this show purposelessly\
And it is not by any concitation\
Of the backward devils.\
I would meet you upon this honestly.\
I that was near your heart was removed therefrom\
To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition.\
I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it\
Since what is kept must be adulterated?\
I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:\
How should I use it for your closer contact?\
These with a thousand small deliberations\
Protract the profit of their chilled delirium,\
Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,\
With pungent sauces, multiply variety\
In a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do,\
Suspend its operations, will the weevil\
Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled\
Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear\
In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits\
Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,\
White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,\
And an old man driven by the Trades\
To a sleepy corner.\
 Tenants of the house,\
Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.\
Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar\
 Tra-la-la-la-la-la-laire\'97nil nisi divinum stabile\

 palace was there, how charming its grey and pink\'97\
 goats and monkeys, with such hair too!\'97so the\
 countess passed on until she came through the\
 little park, where Niobe presented her with a\
 cabinet, and so departed.\
Burbank crossed a little bridge\
Descending at a small hotel;\
Princess Volupine arrived,\
They were together, and he fell.6\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
Defunctive music under sea\
Passed seaward with the passing bell\
Slowly: the God Hercules\
Had left him, that had loved him well.\
The horses, under the axletree\
Beat up the dawn from Istria\
With even feet. Her shuttered barge\
Burned on the water all the day.\
But this or such was Bleistein\'92s way:\
A saggy bending of the knees\
And elbows, with the palms turned out,\
Chicago Semite Viennese.\
A lustreless protrusive eye\
Stares from the protozoic slime\
At a perspective of Canaletto.\
The smoky candle end of time\
Declines. On the Rialto once.\
The rats are underneath the piles.\
The jew is underneath the lot.\
Money in furs. The boatman smiles,\
Princess Volupine extends\
A meagre, blue-nailed, phthisic hand\
To climb the waterstair. Lights, lights,\
She entertains Sir Ferdinand\
Klein. Who clipped the lion\'92s wings\
And flea\'92d his rump and pared his claws?\
Thought Burbank, meditating on\
Time\'92s ruins, and the seven laws.7\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
Sweeney Erect\
 And the trees about me,\
 Let them be dry and leafless; let the rocks\
 Groan with continual surges; and behind me\
 Make all a desolation. Look, look, wenches!\
Paint me a cavernous waste shore\
Cast in the unstilted Cyclades,\
Paint me the bold anfractuous rocks\
Faced by the snarled and yelping seas.\
Display me Aeolus above\
Reviewing the insurgent gales\
Which tangle Ariadne\'92s hair\
And swell with haste the perjured sails.\
Morning stirs the feet and hands\
(Nausicaa and Polypheme),\
Gesture of orang-outang\
Rises from the sheets in steam.\
This withered root of knots of hair\
Slitted below and gashed with eyes,\
This oval O cropped out with teeth:\
The sickle motion from the thighs\
Jackknifes upward at the knees\
Then straightens out from heel to hip\
Pushing the framework of the bed\
And clawing at the pillow slip.\
Sweeney addressed full length to shave\
Broadbottomed, pink from nape to base,\
Knows the female temperament\
And wipes the suds around his face.\
(The lengthened shadow of a man\
Is history, said Emerson\
Who had not seen the silhouette\
Of Sweeney straddled in the sun).\
Tests the razor on his leg\
Waiting until the shriek subsides.\
The epileptic on the bed\
Curves backward, clutching at her sides.\
The ladies of the corridor\
Find themselves involved, disgraced,\
Call witness to their principles\
And deprecate the lack of taste8\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
Observing that hysteria\
Might easily be misunderstood;\
Mrs. Turner intimates\
It does the house no sort of good.\
But Doris, towelled from the bath,\
Enters padding on broad feet,\
Bringing sal volatile\
And a glass of brandy neat.\

Pipit sate upright in her chair\
 Some distance from where I was sitting;\
Views of the Oxford Colleges\
 Lay on the table, with the knitting.\
Daguerreotypes and silhouettes,\
 Her grandfather and great great aunts,\
Supported on the mantelpiece\
 An Invitation to the Dance.\
 . . . . . .\
I shall not want Honour in Heaven\
 For I shall meet Sir Philip Sidney\
And have talk with Coriolanus\
 And other heroes of that kidney.\

 For I shall meet Sir Alfred Mond:\
We two shall lie together, lapt\
 In a five per cent Exchequer Bond.9\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
I shall not want Society in Heaven,\
 Lucretia Borgia shall be my Bride;\
Her anecdotes will be more amusing\
 Than Pipit\'92s experience could provide.\
I shall not want Pipit in Heaven:\
 Madame Blavatsky will instruct me\
In the Seven Sacred Trances;\
 Piccarda de Donati will conduct me ...\
 . . . . . .\
But where is the penny world I bought\
 To eat with Pipit behind the screen?\
The red-eyed scavengers are creeping\
 From Kentish Town and Golder\'92s Green;\
Where are the eagles and the trumpets?\
 Buried beneath some snow-deep Alps.\
Over buttered scones and crumpets\
 Weeping, weeping multitudes\
Droop in a hundred A.B.C.\'92s\

T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
The Hippopotamus\
 Similiter et omnes revereantur Diaconos, ut\
 mandatum Jesu Christi; et Episcopum, ut Jesum\
 Christum, existentem filium Patris; Presbyteros\
 autem, ut concilium Dei et conjunctionem\
 Apostolorum. Sine his Ecclesia non vocatur; de\
 quibus suadeo vos sic habeo.\
 S. IGNATII AD TRALLIANOS.\
 And when this epistle is read among you, cause\
 that it be read also in the church of the\
 Laodiceans.\
The broad-backed hippopotamus\
Rests on his belly in the mud;\
Although he seems so firm to us\
He is merely flesh and blood.\
Flesh-and-blood is weak and frail,\
Susceptible to nervous shock;\
While the True Church can never fail\
For it is based upon a rock.\
The hippo\'92s feeble steps may err\
In compassing material ends,\
While the True Church need never stir\
To gather in its dividends.\
The \'91potamus can never reach\
The mango on the mango-tree;\
But fruits of pomegranate and peach\
Refresh the Church from over sea.\
At mating time the hippo\'92s voice\
Betrays inliexions hoarse and odd,\
But every week we hear rejoice\
The Church, at being one with God.\
The hippopotamus\'92s day\
Is passed in sleep; at night he hunts;\
God works in a mysterious way\'96\
The Church can sleep and feed at once.\
I saw the \'91potamus take wing\
Ascending from the damp savannas,\
And quiring angels round him sing\
The praise of God, in loud hosannas.\
Blood of the Lamb shall wash him clean\
And him shall heavenly arms enfold,12\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
Among the saints he shall be seen\
Performing on a harp of gold.\
He shall be washed as white as snow,\
By all the martyr\'92d virgins kiss,\
While the True Church remains below\
Wrapt in the old miasmal mist.\
Dans le Restaurant\
Le garcon d\'e9labr\'e9 qui n\'92a rien \'e0 faire\
Que de se gratter les doigts et se pencher sur mon\
\'e9paule:\
 \'93Dans mon pays il fera temps pluvieux,\
 Du vent, du grand soleil, et de la pluie;\
 C\'92est ce qu\'92on appelle le jour de lessive des gueux.\'94\
(Bavard, baveux, \'e0 la croupe arrondie,\
Je te prie, au moins, ne bave pas dans la soupe).\
 \'93Les saules tremp\'e9s, et des bourgeons sur les ronces\'97\
 C\'92est l\'e0, dans une averse, qu\'92on s\'92abrite.\
J\'92avais septtans, elle \'e9tait plus petite.\
 Elle etait toute mouill\'e9e, je lui ai donn\'e9 des\
primav\'e8res.\'94\
Les t\'e2ches de son gilet montent au chiffre de trente-huit.\
 \'93Je la chatouillais, pour la faire rire.\
 J\'92\'e9prouvais un instant de puissance et de d\'e9lire.\
 Mais alors, vieux lubrique, a cet \'e2ge ...\
 \'93Monsieur, le fait est dur.\
 Il est venu, nous peloter, un gros chien;\
 Moi j\'92avais peur, je l\'92ai quittee a mi-chemin.\
 C\'92est dommage.\'94\
 Mais alors, tu as ton vautour!\
Va t\'92en te d\'e9crotter les rides du visage;13\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
Tiens, ma fourchette, d\'e9crasse-toi le cr\'e2ne.\
De quel droit payes-tu des exp\'e9riences comme moi?\
Tiens, voil\'e0 dix sous, pour la salle-de-bains.\
Phl\'e9bas, le Ph\'e9nicien, pendant quinze jours noy\'e9,\
Oubliait les cris des mouettes et la houle de Cornouaille,\
Et les profits et les pertes, et la cargaison d\'92etain:\
Un courant de sous-mer l\'92emporta tres loin,\
Le repassant aux \'e9tapes de sa vie ant\'e9rieure.\
Figurez-vous donc, c\'92etait un sort penible;\
Cependant, ce fut jadis un bel homme, de haute taille.\
Whispers of Immortality\
Webster was much possessed by death\
And saw the skull beneath the skin;\
And breastless creatures under ground\
Leaned backward with a lipless grin.\
Daffodil bulbs instead of balls\
Stared from the sockets of the eyes!\
He knew that thought clings round dead limbs\
Tightening its lusts and luxuries.\
Donne, I suppose, was such another\
Who found no substitute for sense;\
To seize and clutch and penetrate,\
Expert beyond experience,\
He knew the anguish of the marrow\
The ague of the skeleton;\
No contact possible to flesh\
Allayed the fever of the bone.\
. . . . .\
Grishkin is nice: her\
Russian eye is underlined for emphasis;\
Uncorseted, her friendly bust\
Gives promise of pneumatic bliss.14\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
The couched Brazilian jaguar\
Compels the scampering marmoset\
With subtle effluence of cat;\
Grishkin has a maisonette;\
The sleek Brazilian jaguar\
Does not in its arboreal gloom\
Distil so rank a feline smell\
As Grishkin in a drawing-room.\
And even the Abstract Entities\
Circumambulate her charm;\
But our lot crawls between dry ribs\
To keep our metaphysics warm.\
Mr. Eliot\'92s Sunday Morning Service\
 Look, look, master, here comes two religions\
 caterpillars.\
 The Jew of Malta.\
Polyphiloprogenitive\
The sapient sutlers of the Lord\
Drift across the window-panes.\
In the beginning was the Word.\
In the beginning was the Word.\
Superfetation of [Greek text inserted here],\
And at the mensual turn of time\
Produced enervate Origen.\
A painter of the Umbrian school\
Designed upon a gesso ground\
The nimbus of the Baptized God.\
The wilderness is cracked and browned\
But through the water pale and thin\
Still shine the unoffending feet\
And there above the painter set\
The Father and the Paraclete.\
. . . . .15\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
The sable presbyters approach\
The avenue of penitence;\
The young are red and pustular\
Clutching piaculative pence.\
Under the penitential gates\
Sustained by staring Seraphim\
Where the souls of the devout\
Burn invisible and dim.\
Along the garden-wall the bees\
With hairy bellies pass between\
The staminate and pistilate,\
Blest office of the epicene.\
Sweeney shifts from ham to ham\
Stirring the water in his bath.\
The masters of the subtle schools\
Are controversial, polymath.\
Sweeney Among the Nightingales\
Apeneck Sweeney spreads his knees\
Letting his arms hang down to laugh,\
The zebra stripes along his jaw\
Swelling to maculate giraffe.\
The circles of the stormy moon\
Slide westward toward the River Plate,\
Death and the Raven drift above\
And Sweeney guards the horned gate.\
Gloomy Orion and the Dog\
Are veiled; and hushed the shrunken seas;\
The person in the Spanish cape\
Tries to sit on Sweeney\'92s knees\
Slips and pulls the table cloth\
Overturns a coffee-cup,\
Reorganized upon the floor\
She yawns and draws a stocking up;\
The silent man in mocha brown\
Sprawls at the window-sill and gapes;16\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
The waiter brings in oranges\
Bananas figs and hothouse grapes;\
The silent vertebrate in brown\
Contracts and concentrates, withdraws;\
Rachel n\'e9e Rabinovitch\
Tears at the grapes with murderous paws;\
She and the lady in the cape\
Are suspect, thought to be in league;\
Therefore the man with heavy eyes\
Declines the gambit, shows fatigue,\
Leaves the room and reappears\
Outside the window, leaning in,\
Branches of wisteria\
Circumscribe a golden grin;\
The host with someone indistinct\
Converses at the door apart,\
The nightingales are singing near\
The Convent of the Sacred Heart,\
And sang within the bloody wood\
When Agamemnon cried aloud,\
And let their liquid droppings fall\
To stain the stiff dishonoured shroud.\
The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\
 S\'92io credesse chc mia risposta fosse\
 A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,\
 Questa Gamma staria senza piu scosse.\
 Ma perciocche giammai di questo fondo\
 Non torno viva alcun, s\'92i\'92odo il vero,\
 Senza tema d\'92infamia ti rispondo.\
Let us go then, you and I,\
When the evening is spread out against the sky\
Like a patient etherized upon a table;\
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,\
The muttering retreats\
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels\
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:\
Streets that follow like a tedious argument\
Of insidious intent\
To lead you to an overwhelming question.\'85\
Oh, do not ask, \'93What is it?\'94\
Let us go and make our visit.\
In the room the women come and go\
Talking of Michelangelo.\
The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,17\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes\
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,\
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,\
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,\
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,\
And seeing that it was a soft October night,\
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.\
And indeed there will be time\
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,\
Rubbing its back upon the window panes;\
There will be time, there will be time\
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet\
There will be time to murder and create,\
And time for all the works and days of hands\
That lift and drop a question on your plate;\
Time for you and time for me,\
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,\
And for a hundred visions and revisions,\
Before the taking of a toast and tea.\
In the room the women come and go\
Talking of Michelangelo.\
And indeed there will be time\
To wonder, \'93Do I dare?\'94 and, \'93Do I dare?\'94\
Time to turn back and descend the stair,\
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair\'97\
(They will say: \'93How his hair is growing thin!\'94)\
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin\'97\
(They will say: \'93But how his arms and legs are thin!\'94)\
Do I dare\
Disturb the universe?\
In a minute there is time\
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.\
For I have known them all already, known them all:\
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,\
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;\
I know the voices dying with a dying fall\
Beneath the music from a farther room.\
 So how should I presume?\
And I have known the eyes already, known them all\'97\
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,\
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,\
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,\
Then how should I begin\
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?\
 And how should I presume?\
And I have known the arms already, known them all\'97\
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare18\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)\
Is it perfume from a dress\
That makes me so digress?\
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.\
And should I then presume?\
 And how should I begin?\
. . . . . . . . .\
Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets\
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes\
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?\
I should have been a pair of ragged claws\
Scuttling across the doors of silent seas.\
. . . . . . . . .\
And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!\
Smoothed by long fingers,\
Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers.\
Stretched on on the floor, here beside you and me.\
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,\
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,\
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald)\
brought in upon a platter,\
I am no prophet\'97and here\'92s no great matter;\
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\
And in short, I was afraid.\
And would it have been worth it, after all,\
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,\
Would it have been worth while,\
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,\
To have squeezed the universe into a ball\
To roll it toward some overwhelming question,\
To say: \'93I am Lazarus, come from the dead,\
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all\'94\'97\
If one, settling a pillow by her head,\
Should say: \'93That is not what I meant at all;\
That is not it, at all.\'94\
And would it have been worth it, after all,\
Would it have been worth while,\
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,\
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts\
that trail along the floor\'97\
And this, and so much more?\'97\
It is impossible to say just what I mean!\
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:\
Would it have been worth while If one, settling a\
pillow or throwing off a shawl,\
And turning toward the window, should say:\
 \'93That is not it at all,\
 That is not what I meant, at all.\'9419\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
. . . . . . . . .\
No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;\
Am an attendant lord, one that will do\
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,\
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,\
Deferential, glad to be of use,\
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;\
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;\
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous\'97\
Almost, at times, the Fool.\
I grow old ... I grow old ...\
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\
Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?\
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.\
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.\
I do not think that they will sing to me.\
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves\
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back\
When the wind blows the water white and black.\
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea\
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown\
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.\
Portrait of a Lady\
 Thou hast committed\'97\
 Fornication: but that was in another country\
 And besides, the wench is dead.\
 The Jew of Malta.\
I\
Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon\
You have the scene arrange itself\'97as it will seem to do\'97\
With \'93I have saved this afternoon for you\'94;\
And four wax candles in the darkened room,\
Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,\
An atmosphere of Juliet\'92s tomb\
Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.\
We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole\
Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.\
\'93So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul\
Should be resurrected only among friends\
Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom\
That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.\'94\
\'97And so the conversation slips\
Among velleities and carefully caught regrets\
Through attenuated tones of violins\
Mingled with remote cornets\
And begins.20\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
\'93You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,\
And how, how rare and strange it is, to find\
In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,\
(For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!\
How keen you are!)\
To find a friend who has these qualities,\
Who has, and gives\
Those qualities upon which friendship lives.\
How much it means that I say this to you\'97\
Without these friendships\'97life, what cauchemar!\'94\
Among the windings of the violins\
And the ariettes\
Of cracked cornets\
Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins\
Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,\
Capricious monotone\
That is at least one definite \'93false note.\'94\
\'97Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,\
Admire the monuments\
Discuss the late events,\
Correct our watches by the public clocks.\
Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.\
II\
Now that lilacs are in bloom\
She has a bowl of lilacs in her room\
And twists one in her fingers while she talks.\
\'93Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know\
What life is, you should hold it in your hands\'94;\
(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)\
\'93You let it flow from you, you let it flow,\
And youth is cruel, and has no remorse\
And smiles at situations which it cannot see.\'94\
I smile, of course,\
And go on drinking tea.\
\'93Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall\
My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,\
I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world\
To be wonderful and youthful, after all.\'94\
The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune\
Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:\
\'93I am always sure that you understand\
My feelings, always sure that you feel,\
Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.\
You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles\'92 heel.\
You will go on, and when you have prevailed\
You can say: at this point many a one has failed.21\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
But what have I, but what have I, my friend,\
To give you, what can you receive from me?\
Only the friendship and the sympathy\
Of one about to reach her journey\'92s end.\
I shall sit here, serving tea to friends....\'94\
I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends\
For what she has said to me?\
You will see me any morning in the park\
Reading the comics and the sporting page.\
Particularly I remark An English countess goes upon the stage.\
A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,\
Another bank defaulter has confessed.\
I keep my countenance, I remain self-possessed\
Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired\
Reiterates some worn-out common song\
With the smell of hyacinths across the garden\
Recalling things that other people have desired.\
Are these ideas right or wrong?\
III\
The October night comes down; returning as before\
Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease\
I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door\
And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.\
\'93And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?\
But that\'92s a useless question.\
You hardly know when you are coming back,\
You will find so much to learn.\'94\
My smile falls heavily among the bric-\'e0-brac.\
\'93Perhaps you can write to me.\'94\
My self-possession flares up for a second;\
This is as I had reckoned.\
\'93I have been wondering frequently of late\
(But our beginnings never know our ends!)\
Why we have not developed into friends.\'94\
I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark\
Suddenly, his expression in a glass.\
My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.\
\'93For everybody said so, all our friends,\
They all were sure our feelings would relate\
So closely! I myself can hardly understand.22\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
We must leave it now to fate.\
You will write, at any rate.\
Perhaps it is not too late.\
I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.\'94\
And I must borrow every changing shape\
To find expression ... dance, dance\
Like a dancing bear,\
Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.\
Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance\'97\
Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,\
Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;\
Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand\
With the smoke coming down above the housetops;\
Doubtful, for quite a while\
Not knowing what to feel or if I understand\
Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon \'85\
Would she not have the advantage, after all?\
This music is successful with a \'93dying fall\'94\
Now that we talk of dying\'97\
And should I have the right to smile?\
Preludes\
I\
The winter evening settles down\
With smell of steaks in passageways.\
Six o\'92clock.\
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.\
And now a gusty shower wraps\
The grimy scraps\
Of withered leaves about your feet\
And newspapers from vacant lots;\
The showers beat\
On broken blinds and chimney-pots,\
And at the corner of the street\
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.\
And then the lighting of the lamps.23\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
II\
The morning comes to consciousness\
Of faint stale smells of beer\
From the sawdust-trampled street\
With all its muddy feet that press\
To early coffee-stands.\
With the other masquerades\
That time resumes,\
One thinks of all the hands\
That are raising dingy shades\
In a thousand furnished rooms.\
III\
You tossed a blanket from the bed,\
You lay upon your back, and waited;\
You dozed, and watched the night revealing\
The thousand sordid images\
Of which your soul was constituted;\
They flickered against the ceiling.\
And when all the world came back\
And the light crept up between the shutters,\
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,\
You had such a vision of the street\
As the street hardly understands;\
Sitting along the bed\'92s edge, where\
You curled the papers from your hair,\
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet\
In the palms of both soiled hands.24\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
IV\
His soul stretched tight across the skies\
That fade behind a city block,\
Or trampled by insistent feet\
At four and five and six o\'92clock;\
And short square fingers stuffing pipes,\
And evening newspapers, and eyes\
Assured of certain certainties,\
The conscience of a blackened street\
Impatient to assume the world.\
I am moved by fancies that are curled\
Around these images, and cling:\
The notion of some infinitely gentle\
Infinitely suffering thing.\
Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;\
The worlds revolve like ancient women\
Gathering fuel in vacant lots.\
Rhapsody on a Windy Night\
Twelve o\'92clock.\
Along the reaches of the street\
Held in a lunar synthesis,\
Whispering lunar incantations\
Disolve the floors of memory\
And all its clear relations,\
Its divisions and precisions,\
Every street lamp that I pass\
Beats like a fatalistic drum,\
And through the spaces of the dark\
Midnight shakes the memory\
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.\
Half-past one,\
The street lamp sputtered,\
The street lamp muttered,\
The street lamp said,\
\'93Regard that woman\
Who hesitates toward you in the light of the door\
Which opens on her like a grin.\
You see the border of her dress\
Is torn and stained with sand,\
And you see the corner of her eye\
Twists like a crooked pin.\'9425\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
The memory throws up high and dry\
A crowd of twisted things;\
A twisted branch upon the beach\
Eaten smooth, and polished\
As if the world gave up\
The secret of its skeleton,\
Stiff and white.\
A broken spring in a factory yard,\
Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left\
Hard and curled and ready to snap.\
Half-past two,\
The street-lamp said,\
\'93Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,\
Slips out its tongue\
And devours a morsel of rancid butter.\'94\
So the hand of the child, automatic,\
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along\
the quay.\
I could see nothing behind that child\'92s eye.\
I have seen eyes in the street\
Trying to peer through lighted shutters,\
And a crab one afternoon in a pool,\
An old crab with barnacles on his back,\
Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.\
Half-past three,\
The lamp sputtered,\
The lamp muttered in the dark.\
The lamp hummed:\
\'93Regard the moon,\
La lune ne garde aucune rancune,\
She winks a feeble eye,\
She smiles into corners.\
She smooths the hair of the grass.\
The moon has lost her memory.\
A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,\
Her hand twists a paper rose,\
That smells of dust and old Cologne,\
She is alone With all the old nocturnal smells\
That cross and cross across her brain.\
The reminiscence comes\
Of sunless dry geraniums\
And dust in crevices,\
Smells of chestnuts in the streets\
And female smells in shuttered rooms\
And cigarettes in corridors\
And cocktail smells in bars.\'94\
The lamp said,\
\'93Four o\'92clock,\
Here is the number on the door.26\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
Memory!\
You have the key,\
The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,\
Mount.\
The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,\
Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.\'94\
The last twist of the knife.\
Morning at the Window\
They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens,\
And along the trampled edges of the street\
I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids\
Sprouting despondently at area gates.\
The brown waves of fog toss up to me\
Twisted faces from the bottom of the street,\
And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts\
An aimless smile that hovers in the air\
And vanishes along the level of the roofs.27\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
The Boston Evening Transcript\
The readers of the Boston Evening Transcript\
Sway in the wind like a field of ripe corn.\
When evening quickens faintly in the street,\
Wakening the appetites of life in some\
And to others bringing the Boston Evening Transcript,\
I mount the steps and ring the bell, turning\
Wearily, as one would turn to nod good-bye to\
Rochefoucauld,\
If the street were time and he at the end of the street,\
And I say, \'93Cousin Harriet, here is the Boston Evening\
Transcript.\'94\
Aunt Helen\
Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt,\
And lived in a small house near a fashionable square\
Cared for by servants to the number of four.\
Now when she died there was silence in heaven\
And silence at her end of the street.\
The shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet\'97\
He was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before.\
The dogs were handsomely provided for,\
But shortly afterwards the parrot died too.\
The Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece,\
And the footman sat upon the dining-table\
Holding the second housemaid on his knees\'97\
Who had always been so careful while her mistress lived.28\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
Cousin Nancy\
Miss Nancy Ellicott Strode across the hills and broke them,\
Rode across the hills and broke them\'97\
The barren New England hills\'97\
Riding to hounds\
Over the cow-pasture.\
Miss Nancy Ellicott smoked\
And danced all the modern dances;\
And her aunts were not quite sure how they felt about it,\
But they knew that it was modern.\
Upon the glazen shelves kept watch\
Matthew and Waldo, guardians of the faith,\
The army of unalterable law.\
Mr. Apollinax\
When Mr. Apollinax visited the United States\
His laughter tinkled among the teacups.\
I thought of Fragilion, that shy figure among the birch-trees,\
And of Priapus in the shrubbery\
Gaping at the lady in the swing.\
In the palace of Mrs. Phlaccus, at Professor Channing-Cheetah\'92s\
He laughed like an irresponsible foetus.\
Otis laughter was submarine and profound\
Like the old man of the sea\'92s\
Hidden under coral islands\
Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green\
silence,\
Dropping from fingers of surf.\
I looked for the head of Mr. Apollinax rolling under a chair\
Or grinning over a screen\
With seaweed in its hair.\
I heard the beat of centaur\'92s hoofs over the hard turf\
As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon.\
\'93He is a charming man\'94\'97\'94But after all what did he mean?\'94\'97\
\'93His pointed ears ... He must be unbalanced,\'94\'97\
\'93There was something he said that I might have challenged.\'94\
Of dowager Mrs. Phlaccus, and Professor and Mrs. Cheetah\
I remember a slice of lemon, and a bitten macaroon.29\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
Hysteria\
As she laughed I was aware of becoming involved in her\
laughter and being part of it, until her teeth were\
only accidental stars with a talent for squad-drill. I\
was drawn in by short gasps, inhaled at each momentary\
recovery, lost finally in the dark caverns of her\
throat, bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles. An\
elderly waiter with trembling hands was hurriedly\
spreading a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty\
green iron table, saying: \'93If the lady and gentleman\
wish to take their tea in the garden, if the lady and\
gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden ...\'94 I\
decided that if the shaking of her breasts could be\
stopped, some of the fragments of the afternoon might\
be collected, and I concentrated my attention with\
careful subtlety to this end.\
Conversation Galante\
I observe: \'93Our sentimental friend the moon!\
Or possibly (fantastic, I confess)\
It may be Prester John\'92s balloon\
Or an old battered lantern hung aloft\
To light poor travellers to their distress.\'94\
 She then: \'93How you digress!\'94\
And I then: \'93Some one frames upon the keys\
That exquisite nocturne, with which we explain\
The night and moonshine; music which we seize\
To body forth our vacuity.\'94\
 She then: \'93Does this refer to me?\'94\
 \'93Oh no, it is I who am inane.\'94\
\'93You, madam, are the eternal humorist,\
The eternal enemy of the absolute,\
Giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist!\
With your aid indifferent and imperious\
At a stroke our mad poetics to confute\'97\'94\
 And\'97\'94Are we then so serious?\'9430\
T. S. Eliot \'96 Poems\
La Figlia Che Piange\
 O quam te memorem Virgo \'85\
Stand on the highest pavement of the stair\'97\
Lean on a garden urn\'97\
Weave, weave the sunlight in your hair\'97\
Clasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise\'97\
Fling them to the ground and turn\
With a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\
But weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\
So I would have had him leave,\
So I would have had her stand and grieve,\
So he would have left\
As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\
As the mind deserts the body it has used.\
I should find\
Some way incomparably light and deft,\
Some way we both should understand,\
Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand.\
She turned away, but with the autumn weather\
Compelled my imagination many days,\
Many days and many hours:\
Her hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\
And I wonder how they should have been together!\
I should have lost a gesture and a pose.\
Sometimes these cogitations still amaze\
The troubled midnight and the noon\'92s repose.}
