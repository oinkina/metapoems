They Went Home 
They went home and told their wives, 
that never once in all their lives, 
had they known a girl like me, 
But . . . They went home. 
They said my house was licking clean, 
no word I spoke was ever mean, 
I had an air of mystery, 
But . . . They went home. 
My praises were on all men's lips, 
they liked my smile, my wit, my hips, 
they'd spend one night, or two or three. 
But. . .

Soft you day, be velvet soft, 
My true love approaches, 
Look you bright, you dusty sun, 
Array your golden coaches. 
Soft you wind, be soft as silk, 
My true love is speaking. 
Hold you birds, your silver throats, 
His golden voice I'm seeking. 
Come you death, in haste, do come, 
My shroud of black be weaving, 
Quiet my heart, be deathly quiet, 
My true love is leaving. 
8 A Zorro Man ^ _ 
Here 
in the wombed room 
silk purple drapes 
flash a light as subtle 
as your hands before 
love-making 
Here 
in the covered lens 
I catch a 
clitoral image of 
your general inhabitation 
long and like a 
late dawn in winter 
Here 
this clean mirror 
traps me unwilling 
in a gone time 
when I was love 
and you were booted and brave 
and trembling for me. 
9 To a Man 
T 
My man is 
Black Golden Amber 
Changing. 
Warm mouths of Brandy Fine 
Cautious sunlight on a patterned rug 
Coughing laughter, rocked on a whorl of French tobacco 
Graceful turns on woolen stilts 
Secretive? 
A cat's eye. 
Southern. Plump and tender with navy-bean sullenness 
And did I say "Tender"? 
The gentleness 
A big cat stalks through stubborn bush 
And did I mention "Amber"? 
The heatless fire consuming itself. 
Again. Anew. Into ever neverlessness. 
My man is Amber 
Changing 
Always into itself 
New. Now New. 
Still itself. 
Still. 
10 Late October 
•fir 
Carefully 
the leaves of autumn 
sprinkle down the tinny 
sound of little dyings 
and skies sated 
of ruddy sunsets 
of roseate dawns 
roil ceaselessly in 
cobweb greys and turn 
to black 
for comfort. 
Only lovers 
see the fall 
a signal end to endings 
a gruffish gesture alerting 
those who will not be alarmed 
that we begin to stop 
in order simply 
to begin 
again.

"I hate to lose something," 
then she bent her head, 
"even a dime, I wish I was dead. 
I can't explain it. No more to be said. 
'Cept I hate to lose something. 
"I lost a doll once and cried for a week. 
She could open her eyes, and do all but speak. 
I believe she was took, by some doll-snatching sneak. 
I tell you, I hate to lose something. 
"A watch of mine once, got up and walked away. 
It had twelve numbers on it and for the time of day. 
I'll never forget it and all I can say 
Is I really hate to lose something. 
"Now if I felt that way 'bout a watch and a toy, 
What you think I feel 'bout my lover-boy? 
I ain't threatening you, madam, but he is my evening's joy. 
And I mean I really hate to lose something." 
12 When You Come to Me 
When you come to me, unbidden, 
Beckoning me 
To long-ago rooms, 
Where memories lie. 
Offering me, as to a child, an attic, 
Gatherings of days too few, 
Baubles of stolen kisses, 
Trinkets of borrowed loves, 
Trunks of secret words, 
I CRY. 
13 Remembering 
At 
Soft grey ghosts crawl up my sleeve 
to peer into my eyes 
while I within deny their threats 
and answer them with lies. 
Mushlike memories perform 
a ritual on my lips 
I lie in stolid hopelessness 
and they lay my soul in strips. 
U In a Time 
T 
In a time of secret wooing 
Today prepares tomorrow's ruin 
Left knows not what right is doing 
My heart is torn asunder. 
In a time of furtive sighs 
Sweet hellos and sad goodbyes 
Half-truths told and entire lies 
My conscience echoes thunder. 
In a time when kingdoms come 
Joy is brief as summer's fun 
Happiness its race has run 
Then pain stalks in to plunder. 
15 Tears 
T 
Tears 
The crystal rags 
Viscous tatters 
of a worn-through soul. 
Moans 
Deep swan song 
Blue farewell 
of a dying dream. 
16 The Detached 
* 
We die, 
Welcoming Bluebeards to our darkening closets, 
Stranglers to our outstretched necks, 
Stranglers, who neither care nor 
care to know that 
DEATH IS INTERNAL. 
We pray, 
Savoring sweet the teethed lies, 
Bellying the grounds before alien gods, 
Gods, who neither know nor 
wish to know that 
HELL IS INTERNAL. 
We love, 
Rubbing the nakednesses with gloved hands, 
Inverting our mouths in tongued kisses, 
Kisses that neither touch nor 
care to touch if 
LOVE IS INTERNAL. 
17 To a Husband 
Your voice at times a fist 
Tight in your throat 
Jabs ceaselessly at phantoms 
In the room, 
Your hand a carved and 
Skimming boat 
Goes down the Nile 
To point out Pharaoh's tomb. 
You're Africa to me 
At brightest dawn. 
The Congo's green and 
Copper's brackish hue, 
A continent to build 
With Black Man's brawn. 
I sit at home and see it all 
Through you. 
18 Accident 
aj» 
Tonight 
when you spread your pallet 
of magic, 
I escaped. 
Sitting apart, 
I saw you grim and unkempt. 
Your vulgarness 
not of living, 
your demands 
not from need. 
Tonight 
as you sprinkled your brain-dust 
of rainbows, 
I had no eyes. 
Seeing all 
I saw the colors fade 
and change. 
The blood, red dulled 
through the dyes, 
and the naked 
Black-White truth. 
19 Let's Majeste 
I sit a throne upon the times 
when Kings are rare and 
Consorts 
slide into the grease of scullery maids. 
So gaily wave a crown of light 
(astride the royal chair) that blinds 
the commoners who genuflect and cross their fingers. 
The years will lie beside me 
on the queenly bed. 
And coupled we'll await 
the ages' dust to cake my lids again. 
And when the rousing kiss is given, 
why must it always be a fairy, and 
only just a Prince? 
2 0 After 
No sound falls 
from the moaning sky 
No scowl wrinkles 
the evening pool 
The stars lean down 
A stony brilliance 
While birds fly. 
The market leers 
its empty shelves 
Streets bare bosoms 
to scanty cars 
This bed yawns 
beneath the weight 
of our absent selves. 
2 1 The Mothering Blackness 
She came home running 
back to the mothering blackness 
deep in the smothering blackness 
white tears icicle gold plains of her face 
She came home running 
She came down creeping 
here to the black arms waiting 
now to the warm heart waiting 
rime of alien dreams befrosts her rich brown face 
She came down creeping 
She came home blameless 
black yet as Hagar's daughter 
tall as was Sheba's daughter 
threats of northern winds die on the desert's face 
She came home blameless 
22 On Diverse Deviations 
When love is a shimmering curtain 
Before a door of chance 
That leads to a world in question 
Wherein the macabrous dance 
Of bones that rattle in silence 
Of blinded eyes and rolls 
Of thick lips thin, denying 
A thousand powdered moles, 
Where touch to touch is feel 
And life a weary whore 
I would be carried off, not gently 
To a shore, 
Where love is the scream of anguish 
And no curtain drapes the door. 
23 Mourning Grace 
If today I follow death, 
go down its trackless wastes, 
salt my tongue on hardened tears 
for my precious dear time's waste 
race 
along that promised cave in a headlong 
deadlong 
haste, 
Will you 
have 
the 
grace 
to mourn for 
me? 
24 How I Can Lie to You 
now thread my voice 
with lies 
of lightness 
force within 
my mirror eyes 
the cold disguise 
of sad and wise 
decisions. 
25 Sounds Like Pearls 
Sounds 
Like pearls 
Roll off your tongue 
To grace this eager ebon ear. 
Doubt and fear, 
Ungainly things, 
With blushings 
Disappear.

91 When I Think About Myself 
At 
When I think about myself, 
I almost laugh myself to death, 
My life has been one great big joke, 
A dance that's walked, 
A song that's spoke, 
I laugh so hard I almost choke, 
When I think about myself. 
Sixty years in these folks' world, 
The child I works for calls me girl, 
I say "Yes ma'am" for working's sake. 
Too proud to bend, 
Too poor to break, 
I laugh until my stomach ache, 
When I think about myself. 
My folks can make me split my side, 
I laughed so hard I nearly died, 
The tales they tell sound just like lying, 
They grow the fruit, 
But eat the rind, 
I laugh until I start to crying, 
When I think about my folks. 
2 9 On a Bright Day, Next Week 
On a bright day, next week 
Just before the bomb falls 
Just before the world ends 
Just before I die 
All my tears will powder 
Black in dust like ashes 
Black like Buddha's belly 
Black and hot and dry 
Then will mercy tumble 
Falling down in godheads 
Falling on the children 
Falling from the sky 
30 Letter to an Aspiring Junkie 
Let me hip you to the streets, 
Jim, 
Ain't nothing happening. 
Maybe some tomorrows gone up in smoke, 
raggedy preachers, telling a joke 
to lonely, son-less old ladies' maids. 
Nothing happening, 
Nothing shakin', Jim. 
A slough of young cats riding that 
cold, white horse, 
a grey old monkey on their back, of course, 
does rodeo tricks. 
No haps, man. 
No haps. 
A worn-out pimp, with a space-age conk, 
setting up some fool for a game of tonk, 
or poker or 
get 'em dead and alive. 
The streets? 
Climb into the streets, man, like you climb 
into the ass end of a lion. 
Then it's fine. 
It's a bug-a-loo and a shing-a-ling, 
African dreams on a buck-and-a-wing and a prayer. 
That's the streets, man, 
Nothing happening.

When cane straps flog the body 
dark and lean, you feel the blow. 
I hear it in your breath.

We saw beyond our seeming 
These days of bloodied screaming 
Of children dying bloated 
Out where the lilies floated 
Of men all noosed and dangling 
Within the temples strangling 
Our guilt grey fungus growing 
We knew and lied our knowing 
Deafened and unwilling 
We aided in the killing 
And now our souls lie broken 
Dry tablets without token. 
40 Black Ode 
• 
Your beauty is a thunder 
And I am set a wandering—a wandering 
Deafened 
Down twilight tin-can alleys 
And moist sounds 
"OOo wee, Baby, look what you could get if your name 
was Willie" 
Oh, to dip your words like snuff. 
A laughter, black and streaming 
And I am come a being—a being 
Rounded 
Up Baptist aisles, so moaning 
And moist sounds 
"Bless her heart. Take your bed and walk. 
You been heavy burdened" 
Oh, to lick your love like tears. 
41 No No No No 
V 
No 
the two-legg'd beasts 
that walk like men 
play stink finger in their crusty asses 
while crackling babies 
in napalm coats 
stretch mouths to receive 
burning tears 
on splitting tongues 
JUST GIVE ME A COOL DRINK OF WATER 'FORE I DIIIE 
No 
the gap-legg'd whore 
of the eastern shore 
enticing Europe to COME 
in her 
and turns her pigeon-shit back to me 
to me 
who stoked the coal that drove the ships 
which brought her over the sinuous cemetery 
of my many brothers 
No 
the cocktailed afternoons 
of what can I do. 
In my white layered pink world 
I've let your men cram my mouth 
with their black throbbing hate 
and I swallowed after 
42 I've let your mammies 
steal from my kitchens 
(I was always half-amused) 
I've chuckled the chins of 
your topsy-haired pickaninnies. 
What more can I do? 
I'll never be black like you. 
(HALLELUJAH) 
No 
the red-shoed priests riding 
palanquined 
in barefoot children country 
the plastered saints gazing down 
beneficently 
on kneeling mothers 
picking undigested beans 
from yesterday's shit. 
I have waited 
toes curled, hat rolled 
heart and genitals 
in hand 
on the back porches 
of forever 
in the kitchens and fields 
of rejections 
on the cold marble steps 
of America's White Out-House 
in the drop seats of buses 
and the open flies of war 
No more 
the dream that you 
will cease haunting me 
down in fetid swamps of fear 
43 and will turn to embrace your own 
humanity 
which I AM 
No more 
the hope that 
the razored insults 
which mercury-slide over your tongue 
will be forgotten 
and you will learn the words of love 
Mother Brother Father Sister Lover Friend 
My hopes 
dying slowly 
rose petals falling 
beneath an autumn red moon 
will not adorn your unmarked graves 
My dreams 
lying quietly 
a dark pool under the trees 
will not carry your name 
to a forgetful shore 
And what a pity 
What a pity 
that pity has folded in upon itself 
an old man's mouth 
whose teeth are gone 
and I have no pity. 
44 My Guilt 
My guilt is "slavery's chains," too long 
the clang of iron falls down the years. 
This brother's sold, this sister's gone, 
is bitter wax, lining my ears. 
My guilt made music with the tears. 
My crime is "heroes, dead and gone," 
dead Vesey, Turner, Gabriel, 
dead Malcolm, Marcus, Martin King. 
They fought too hard, they loved too well. 
My crime is I'm alive to tell. 
My sin is "hanging from a tree," 
I do not scream, it makes me proud. 
I take to dying like a man. 
I do it to impress the crowd. 
My sin lies in not screaming loud. 
45 The Calling of Names 
He went to being called a colored man 
after answering to "hey, nigger." 
Now that's a big jump, 
anyway you figger. 
Hey, Baby, watch my smoke. 
From colored man to Negro, 
With the N in caps, 
was like saying Japanese 
instead of saying Japs. 
I mean, during the war. 
The next big step 
was a change for true, 
From Negro in caps 
to being a Jew. 
Now, Sing, Yiddish Mama. 
Light, Yellow, Brown 
and Dark-brown skin, 
were okay colors to 
describe him then. 
He was a Bouquet of Roses. 
He changed his seasons 
like an almanac. 
Now you'll get hurt 
if you don't call him "Black." 
Nigguh, I ain't playin' this time. 
46 On Working White Liberals 
I don't ask the Foreign Legion 
Or anyone to win my freedom 
Or to fight my battle better than I can, 
Though there's one thing that I cry for 
I believe enough to die for 
That is every man's responsibility to man. 
I'm afraid they'll have to prove first 
That they'll watch the Black man move first 
Then follow him with faith to kingdom come. 
This rocky road is not paved for us, 
So, I'll believe in Liberals' aid for us 
When I see a white man load a Black man's gun. 
47 Sepia Fashion Show 
Their hair, pomaded, faces jaded 
bones protruding, hip-wise, 
the models strutted, backed and butted, 
then stuck their mouths out, lip-wise. 
They'd nasty manners, held like banners, 
while they looked down their nose-wise. 
I'd see 'em in hell, before they'd sell 
me one thing they're wearing, clothes-wise. 
The Black Bourgeois, who all say "yah" 
when yeah is what they're meaning, 
should look around, both up and down, 
before they set out preening. 
"Indeed," they swear, "that's what I'll wear 
when I go country-clubbing." 
I'd remind them please, look at those knees,

But forty 
with the authorized 
brazenness of a uniformed

no-knocking

63 The Telephone 
It comes in black

beige. In red and chaperons my life. 
Sitting like a strict 
and spinstered aunt 
spiked between my needs 
and need. 
It tats the day, crocheting 
other people's lives 
in neat arrangements, 
ignoring me, 
busy with the hemming 
of strangers' overlong affairs or 
the darning of my 
neighbors' worn-out 
dreams. 
From Monday, the morning of the week, 
through mid-times 
noon and Sunday's dying

Its needle sound 
does not transfix my ear

unrehearsed 
to crush against my 
empty chest. 
That cool spring 
was shortened by 
your summer, bold, impatient 
and all forgotten 
except when silence 
turns the key 
into my midnight bedroom 
and comes to sleep upon your 
pillow. 
68 Greyday 
The day hangs heavy 
loose and grey 
when you're away. 
A crown of thorns 
a shirt of hair 
is what I wear. 
No one knows 
my lonely heart 
when we're apart. 
69 Poor Girl 
T 
You've got another love 
and I know it 
Someone who adores you 
just like me 
Hanging on your words 
like they were gold 
Thinking that she understands 
your soul 
Poor Girl 
Just like me. 
You're breaking another heart 
and I know it 
And there's nothing 
I can do 
If I try to tell her 
what I know 
She'll misunderstand 
and make me go 
Poor Girl 
Just like me. 
You're going to leave her too 
and I know it 
She'll never know 
what made you go 
She'll cry and wonder 
what went wrong 
70 Then she'll begin 
to sing this song 
Poor Girl 
Just like me. 
71 Come. And Be My Baby 
The highway is full of big cars 
going nowhere fast 
And folks is smoking anything that'll burn 
Some people wrap their lives around a cocktail glass 
And you sit wondering 
where you're going to turn. 
I got it. 
Come. And be my baby. 
Some prophets say the world is gonna end tomorrow 
But others say we've got a week or two 
The paper is full of every kind of blooming horror 
And you sit wondering 
What you're gonna do. 
I got it. 
Come. And be my baby. 
72 Senses of Insecurity 
I couldn't tell fact from fiction 
or if my dream was true, 
The only sure prediction 
in this whole world was you. 
I'd touched your features inchly, 
heard love and dared the cost. 
The scented spiel reeled me unreal 
and found my senses lost. 
73 Alone 
T 
Lying, thinking 
Last night 
How to find my soul a home 
Where water is not thirsty 
And bread loaf is not stone 
I came up with one thing 
And I don't believe I'm wrong 
That nobody, 
But nobody 
Can make it out here alone. 
Alone, all alone 
Nobody, but nobody 
Can make it out here alone. 
There are some millionaires 
With money they can't use 
Their wives run round like banshees 
Their children sing the blues 
They've got expensive doctors 
To cure their hearts of stone. 
But nobody 
No, nobody 
Can make it out here alone. 
Alone, all alone 
Nobody, but nobody 
Can make it out here alone. 
74 Now if you listen closely 
I'll tell you what I know 
Storm clouds are gathering 
The wind is gonna blow 
The race of man is suffering 
And I can hear the moan, 
'Cause nobody, 
But nobody 
Can make it out here alone. 
Alone, all alone 
Nobody, but nobody 
Can make it out here alone. 
75 Communication I 
"V 
She wished of him a lover's kiss and 
nights of coupled twining. 
They laced themselves 
between the trees 
and to the water's edge. 
Reminding her 
the cratered moon lay light-years away, 
he spoke of Greece, the Parthenon 
and Cleopatra's barge. 
She splayed her foot 
up to the shin 
within the ocean brine. 
He quoted Pope and Bernard Shaw 
and Catcher in the Rye. 
Her sandal lost, 
she dried her toe 
and then she mopped her brow. 
Dry-eyed 
she walked into her room 
and frankly told her mother, 
"Of all he said, I understood 
he said he loved another." 
76 Communication II 
FOR ADELE 
The Student 
The dust of ancient pages 
had never touched his face, 
and fountains black and comely 
were mummied in a place 
beyond 
his young un-knowing. 
The Teacher 
She shared the lettered strivings 
of etched Pharaonic walls 
and Reconstruction's anguish 
resounded down the halls 
of all her 
dry dreams. 
77 Wonder 
^ 
A day 
drunk with the nectar of 
nowness 
weaves its way between 
the years 
to find itself at the flophouse 
of night 
to sleep and be seen 
no more. 
Will I be less 
dead because I wrote this 
poem or you more because 
you read it 
long years hence. 
78 A Conceit 
Give me your hand. 
Make room for me 
to lead and follow 
you 
beyond this rage of poetry. 
Let others have 
the privacy of 
touching words 
and love of loss 
of love. 
For me 
Give me your hand. 
The Couple 
Discard the fear and what 
was she? Of rag and bones 
a mimicry of woman's 
fairy-ness 
Archaic at its birth. 
Discharge the hate and when 
was he? Disheveled moans 
a mimesis of man's 
estate 
deceited for its worth. 
Dissolve the greed and why 
were they? Enfeebled thrones 
a memory of mortal 
kindliness 
exiled from this earth. 
93 The Pusher

He bad 
O he bad 
He make a honky 
poot. Make a honky's 
blue eyes squint 
anus tight, when 
my man look in 
the light blue eyes. 
He thinks 
He don't play 
His Afro crown raises 
eyes. Raises eyebrows 
of wonder and dark 
envy when he, combed 
out, hits the street. 
He sleek 
Dashiki 
Wax-printed on his skin 
remembrances of Congo dawns 
laced across his chest. 
Red Blood Red and Black. 
He bought 
O he got 
Malcolm's paper 
back. Checked out the 
photo, caught a few godly 
94 lines. Then wondered how 
many wives/daughters of 
Honky (miscalled The Man) 
bird snake 
caught, dug them both. 
(Him, Fro-ed Dashiki-ed 
and the book.) 
He stashed 
He stands stashed 
Near, too near the MLK 
Library. P.S. naught 
naught naught. Breathing 
slaughter on the Malcolm X 
Institute. Whole fist 
balled, fingers pressing 
palm. Shooting up through 
Honky's blue-eyed sky. 
"BLACK IS!" 
"NATION TIME!" 
"TOMORROW'S GLORY HERE TODAY" 
Pry free the hand 
Observe our Black present. 
There lie soft on that 
copper palm, a death of 
coke. A kill of horse 
eternal night's barbiturates. 
One hundred youths 
sped down to 
Speed. 
He right 
O he bad 
95 He badder than death 
yet gives no sweet 
release. 
96 Chicken-Licken 
She was afraid of men, 
sin and the humors 
of the night. 
Whe n she saw a bed 
locks clicked 
in her brain. 
She screwed a frown 
around and plugged 
it in the keyhole. 
Put a chain across 
her door and closed 
her mind. 
Her bones were found 
round thirty years later 
when they razed 
her building to 
put up a parking lot. 
Autopsy read: 
dead of acute peoplelessness.
