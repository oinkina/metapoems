\f0\fs24 \cf0  1 I was the shadow of the waxwing slain \
 By the false azure in the windowpane; \
 I was the smudge of ashen fluff - and I \
 Lived on, flew on, in the reflected sky. \
 And from the inside, too, I'd duplicate \
 Myself, my lamp, an apple on a plate: \
 Uncurtaining the night, I'd let dark glass \
 Hang all the furniture above the grass, \
 And how delightful when a fall of snow \
10 Covered my glimpse of lawn and reached up so \
 As to make chair and bed exactly stand \
 Upon that snow, out in that crystal land! \
 \
 Retake the falling snow: each drifting flake \
 Shapeless and slow, unsteady and opaque, \
 A dull dark white against the day's pale white \
 And abstract larches in the neutral light. \
 And then the gradual and dual blue \
 As night unites the viewer and the view, \
 And in the morning, diamonds of frost \
20 Express amazement: Whose spurred feet have crossed\
 From left to right the blank page of the road? \
 Reading from left to right in winter's code: \
 A dot, an arrow pointing back; repeat: \
 Dot, arrow pointing back... A pheasant's feet \
 Torquated beauty, sublimated grouse, \
 Finding your China right behind my house. \
 Was he in Sherlock Holmes, the fellow whose \
 Tracks pointed back when he reversed his shoes? \
 \
 All colors made me happy: even gray. \
30 My eyes were such that literally they \
 Took photographs. Whenever I'd permit, \
 Or, with a silent shiver, order it, \
 Whatever in my field of vision dwelt - \
 An indoor scene, hickory leaves, the svelte \
 Stilettos of a frozen stillicide - \
 Was printed on my eyelids' nether side \
 Where it would tarry for an hour or two, \
 And while this lasted all I had to do \
 Was close my eyes to reproduce the leaves, \
40 Or indoor scene, or trophies of the eaves. \
 \
 I cannot understand why from the lake \
 I could make out our front porch when I'd take \
 Lake Road to school, whilst now, although no tree \
 Has intervened, I look but fail to see \
 Even the roof. Maybe some quirk in space \
 Has caused a fold or furrow to displace \
 The fragile vista, the frame house between \
 Goldsworth and Wordsmith on its square of green. \
 \
 I had a favorite young shagbark there \
50 With ample dark jade leaves and a black, spare, \
 Vermiculated trunk. The setting sun \
 Bronzed the black bark, around which, like undone \
 Garlands, the shadows of the foliage fell. \
 It is now stout and rough; it has done well. \
 White butterflies turn lavender as they \
 Pass through its shade where gently seems to sway \
 The phantom of my little daughter's swing. \
 \
 The house itself is much the same. One wing \
 We've had revamped. There's a solarium. There's \
60 A picture window flanked with fancy chairs. \
 TV's huge paperclip now shines instead \
 Of the stiff vane so often visited \
 By the na\'efve, the gauzy mockingbird \
 Retelling all the programs she had heard; \
 Switching from chippo-chippo to a clear \
 To-wee, to-wee; then rasping out: come here,\
 Come here, come herrr'; flirting her tail aloft, \
 Or gracefully indulging in a soft \
 Upward hop-flop, and instantly (to-wee!) \
70 Returning to her perch - the new TV. \
 \
 I was an infant when my parents died. \
 They both were ornithologists. I've tried \
 So often to evoke them that today \
 I have a thousand parents. Sadly they \
 Dissolve in their own virtues and recede, \
 But certain words, chance words I hear or read, \
 Such as "bad heart" always to him refer, \
 And "cancer of the pancreas" to her. \
 \
 A preterist: one who collects cold nests. \
80 Here was my bedroom, now reserved for guests. \
 Here, tucked away by the Canadian maid, \
 I listened to the buzz downstairs and prayed \
 For everybody to be always well, \
 Uncles and aunts, the maid, her niece Ad\'e9le \
 Who'd seen the Pope, people in books, and God. \
 \
 I was brought up by dear bizarre Aunt Maud, \
 A poet and a painter with a taste \
 For realistic objects interlaced \
 With grotesque growths and images of doom. \
90 She lived to hear the next babe cry. Her room \
 We've kept intact. Its trivia create \
 A still life in her style: the paperweight \
 Of convex glass enclosing a lagoon, \
 The verse book open at the Index (Moon, \
 Moonrise, Moor, Moral), the forlorn guitar, \
 The human skull; and from the local Star\
 A curio: Red Sox Beat Yanks 5-4\
 On Chapman's Homer, thumbtacked to the door. \
 \
 My God died young. Theolatry I found \
100 Degrading, and its premises, unsound. \
 No free man needs a God; but was I free? \
 How fully I felt nature glued to me \
 And how my childish palate loved the taste \
 Half-fish, half-honey, of that golden paste! \
 My picture book was at an early age \
 The painted parchment papering our cage: \
 Mauve rings around the moon; blood-orange sun \
 Twinned Iris; and that rare phenomenon \
 The iridule - when, beautiful and strange, \
110 In a bright sky above a mountain range \
 One opal cloudlet in an oval form \
 Reflects the rainbow of a thunderstorm \
 Which in a distant valley has been staged - \
 For we are most artistically caged. \
 \
 And there's the wall of sound: the nightly wall \
 Raised by a trillion crickets in the fall. \
 Impenetrable! Halfway up the hill \
 I'd pause in thrall of their delirious trill. \
 That's Dr. Sutton's light. That's the Great Bear. \
120 A thousand years ago five minutes were \
 Equal to forty ounces of fine sand. \
 Outstare the stars. Infinite foretime and \
 Infinite aftertime: above your head \
 They close like giant wings, and you are dead. \
\
 The regular vulgarian, I daresay, \
 Is happier: he sees the Milky Way \
 Only when making water. Then as now \
 I walked at my own risk: whipped by the bough, \
 Tripped by the stump. Asthmatic, lame and fat, \
130 I never bounced a ball or swung a bat. \
 \
 I was the shadow of the waxwing slain \
 By feigned remoteness in the windowpane. \
 I had a brain, five senses (one unique); \
 But otherwise I was a cloutish freak. \
 In sleeping dreams I played with other chaps \
 But really envied nothing - save perhaps \
 The miracle of a lemniscate left \
 Upon wet sand by nonchalantly deft \
 Bicycle tires. \
 \
 A thread of subtle pain, \
140 Tugged at by playful death, released again, \
 But always present, ran through me. One day, \
 When I'd just turned eleven, as I lay \
 Prone on the floor and watched a clockwork toy - \
 A tin wheelbarrow pushed by a tin boy - \
 Bypass chair legs and stray beneath the bed, \
 There was a sudden sunburst in my head. \
 \
 And then black night. That blackness was sublime. \
 I felt distributed through space and time: \
 One foot upon a mountaintop, one hand \
150 Under the pebbles of a panting strand, \
 One ear in Italy, one eye in Spain, \
 In caves, my blood, and in the stars, my brain. \
 There were dull throbs in my Triassic; green \
 Optical spots in Upper Pleistocene, \
 An icy shiver down my Age of Stone, \
 And all tomorrows in my funnybone. \
 \
 During one winter every afternoon \
 I'd sink into that momentary swoon. \
 And then it ceased. Its memory grew dim. \
160 My health improved. I even learned to swim. \
 But like some little lad forced by a wench \
 With his pure tongue her abject thirst to quench, \
 I was corrupted, terrified, allured, \
 And though old doctor Colt pronounced me cured \
 Of what, he said, were mainly growing pains, \
 The wonder lingers and the shame remains. \
Canto Two \
 \
 There was a time in my demented youth \
 When somehow I suspected that the truth \
 About survival after death was known - \
170 To every human being: I alone \
 Knew nothing, and a great conspiracy \
 Of books and people hid the truth from me. \
 There was the day when I began to doubt \
 Man's sanity: How could he live without \
 Knowing for sure what dawn, what death, what doom \
 Awaited consciousness beyond the tomb? \
 \
 And finally there was the sleepless night \
 When I decided to explore and fight \
 The foul, the inadmissible abyss, \
180 Devoting all my twisted life to this \
 One task. Today I'm sixty-one. Waxwings \
 Are berry-pecking. A cicada sings. \
 \
 The little scissors I am holding are \
 A dazzling synthesis of sun and star. \
 I stand before the window and I pare \
 My fingernails and vaguely am aware \
 Of certain flinching likenesses: the thumb, \
 Our grocer's son; the index, lean and glum \
 College astronomer Starover Blue; \
190 The middle fellow, a tall priest I knew; \
 The feminine fourth finger, an old flirt; \
 And little pinky clinging to her skirt. \
 And I make mouths as I snip off the thin \
 Strips of what Aunt Maud used to call "scarf-skin." \
 \
 Maud Shade was eighty when a sudden hush \
 Fell on her life. We saw the angry flush \
 And torsion of paralysis assail \
 Her noble cheek. We moved her to Pinedale, \
 Famed for its sanitarium. There she'd sit \
200 In the glassed sun and watch the fly that lit \
 Upon her dress and then upon her wrist. \
 Her mind kept fading in the growing mist. \
 She still could speak. She paused, and groped, and found\
 What seemed at first a serviceable sound, \
 But from adjacent cells impostors took \
 The place of words she needed, and her look \
 Spelt imploration as she sought in vain \
 To reason with the monsters in her brain. \
 \
 What moment in the gradual decay \
210 Does resurrection choose? What years? What day? \
 Who has the stopwatch? Who rewinds the tape? \
 Are some less lucky, or do all escape? \
 A syllogism: other men die; but I\
 Am not another; therefore I'll not die.\
 Space is a swarming in the eyes; and time, \
 A singing in the ears. In this hive I'm \
 Locked up. Yet, if prior to life we had \
 Been able to imagine life, what mad, \
 Impossible, unutterably weird, \
220 Wonderful nonsense it might have appeared! \
 \
 So why join in the vulgar laughter? Why \
 Scorn a hereafter none can verify: \
 The Turk's delight, the future lyres, the talks \
 With Socrates and Proust in cypress walks, \
 The seraph with his six flamingo wings, \
 And Flemish hells with porcupines and things? \
 It isn't that we dream too wild a dream: \
 The trouble is we do not make it seem \
 Sufficiently unlikely; for the most \
230 We can think up is a domestic ghost. \
 \
 How ludicrous these efforts to translate \
 Into one's private tongue a public fate! \
 Instead of poetry divinely terse, \
 Disjointed notes, Insomnia's mean verse! \
 \
 Life is a message scribbled in the dark.\
 Anonymous. \
 Espied on a pine's bark, \
 As we were walking home the day she died, \
 An empty emerald case, squat and frog-eyed, \
 Hugging the trunk; and its companion piece, \
240 A gum-logged ant. \
 That Englishman in Nice, \
 A proud and happy linguist: je nourris\
 Les pauvres cigales - meaning that he \
 Fed the poor sea gulls! \
 Lafontaine was wrong: \
 Dead is the mandible, alive the song. \
 \
 And so I pare my nails, and muse, and hear \
 Your steps upstairs, and all is right, my dear. \
 \
 Sybil, throughout our high-school days I knew \
 Your loveliness, but fell in love with you \
 During an outing of the senior class \
250 To New Wye Falls. We luncheoned on damp grass. \
 Our teacher of geology discussed \
 The cataract. Its roar and rainbow dust \
 Made the tame park romantic. I reclined \
 In April's haze immediately behind \
 Your slender back and watched your neat small head \
 Bend to one side. One palm with fingers spread, \
 Between a star of trillium and a stone, \
 Pressed on the turf. A little phalange bone \
 Kept twitching. Then you turned and offered me \
260 A thimbleful of bright metallic tea. \
 \
 Your profile has not changed. The glistening teeth \
 Biting the careful lip; the shade beneath \
 The eye from the long lashes; the peach down \
 Rimming the cheekbone; the dark silky brown \
 Of hair brushed up from temple and from nape; \
 The very naked neck; the Persian shape \
 Of nose and eyebrow, you have kept it all - \
 And on still nights we hear the waterfall. \
 \
 Come and be worshiped, come and be caressed, \
270 My dark Vanessa, crimson-barred, my blest \
 My Admirable butterfly! Explain \
 How could you, in the gloam of Lilac Lane, \
 Have let uncouth, hysterical John Shade \
 Blubber your face, and ear, and shoulder blade? \
 \
 We have been married forty years. At least \
 Four thousand times your pillow has been creased \
 By our two heads. Four hundred thousand times \
 The tall clock with the hoarse Westminster chimes \
 Has marked our common hour. How many more \
280 Free calendars shall grace the kitchen door? \
 \
 I love you when you're standing on the lawn \
 Peering at something in a tree: "It's gone. \
 It was so small. It might come back" (all this \
 Voiced in a whisper softer than a kiss). \
 I love you when you call me to admire \
 A jet's pink trail above the sunset fire. \
 I love you when you're humming as you pack \
 A suitcase or the farcical car sack \
 With round-trip zipper. And I love you most \
290 When with a pensive nod you greet her ghost \
 And hold her first toy on your palm, or look \
 At a postcard from her, found in a book. \
 \
 She might have been you, me, or some quaint blend: \
 Nature chose me so as to wrench and rend\
 Your heart and mine. At first we'd smile and say: \
 "All little girls are plump" or "Jim McVey \
 (The family oculist) will cure that slight \
 Squint in no time." And later. "She'll be quite \
 Pretty, you know"; and, trying to assuage \
300 The swelling torment: "That's the awkward age." \
 "She should take riding lessons," you would say \
 (Your eyes and mine not meeting). "She should play \
 Tennis, or badminton. Less starch, more fruit! \
 She may not be a beauty, but she's cute." \
 \
 It was no use, no use. The prizes won \
 In French and history, no doubt, were fun; \
 At Christmas parties games were rough, no doubt, \
 And one shy little guest might be left out; \
 But let's be fair: while children of her age \
310 Were cast as elves and fairies on the stage \
 That she'd helped paint for the school pantomime, \
 My gentle girl appeared as Mother Time, \
 A bent charwoman with slop pail and broom, \
 And like a fool I sobbed in the men's room. \
 \
 Another winter was scrape-scooped away. \
 The Toothwort White haunted our woods in May. \
 Summer was power-mowed, and autumn, burned. \
 Alas, the dingy cygnet never turned \
 Into a wood duck. And again your voice: \
320 "But this is prejudice! You should rejoice \
 That she is innocent. Why overstress \
 The physical? She wants to look a mess. \
 Virgins have written some resplendent books. \
 Lovemaking is not everything. Good looks \
 Are not that indispensable!" And still \
 Old Pan would call from every painted hill, \
 And still the demons of our pity spoke: \
 No lips would share the lipstick of her smoke; \
 The telephone that rang before a ball \
330 Every two minutes in Sorosa Hall \
 For her would never ring; and, with a great \
 Screeching of tires on gravel, to the gate \
 Out of the lacquered night, a white-scarfed beau \
 Would never come for her; she'd never go, \
 A dream of gauze and jasmine, to that dance. \
 We sent her, though, to a ch\'e2teau in France. \
 \
 And she returned in tears, with new defeats, \
 New miseries. On days when all the streets \
 Of College Town led to the game, she'd sit \
340 On the library steps, and read or knit; \
 Mostly alone she'd be, or with that nice \
 Frail roommate, now a nun; and, once or twice, \
 With a Korean boy who took my course. \
 She had strange fears, strange fantasies, strange force \
 Of character - as when she spent three nights \
 Investigating certain sounds and lights \
 In an old barn. She twisted words: pot, top, \
 Spider, redips. And "powder" was "red wop." \
 She called you a didactic katydid. \
350 She hardly ever smiled, and when she did, \
 It was a sign of pain. She'd criticize \
 Ferociously our projects, and with eyes \
 Expressionless sit on her tumbled bed \
 Spreading her swollen feet, scratching her head \
 With psoriatic fingernails, and moan, \
 Murmuring dreadful words in monotone. \
 \
 She was my darling. difficult, morose - \
 But still my darling. You remember those \
 Almost unruffled evenings when we played \
360 Mah-jongg, or she tried on your furs, which made \
 Her almost fetching; and the mirrors smiled, \
 The lights were merciful, the shadows mild, \
 Sometimes I'd help her with a Latin text, \
 Or she'd be reading in her bedroom, next \
 To my fluorescent lair, and you would be \
 In your own study, twice removed from me, \
 And I would hear both voices now and then: \
370 "Mother, what's grimpen?" "What is what?" \
 "Grim Pen." \
 Pause, and your guarded scholium. Then again: \
 "Mother, what's chtonic?" That, too, you'd explain, \
 Appending. "Would you like a tangerine?" \
 "No. Yes. And what does sempiternal mean?" \
 You'd hesitate. And lustily I'd roar \
 The answer from my desk through the closed door. \
 \
 It does not matter what it was she read \
 (some phony modern poem that was said \
 In English Lit to be a document \
 "Engazhay and compelling" - what this meant \
 Nobody cared); the point is that the three \
380 Chambers, then bound by you and her and me, \
 Now form a tryptich or a three-act play \
 In which portrayed events forever stay. \
 \
 I think she always nursed a small mad hope. \
 \
 I'd finished recently my book on Pope. \
 Jane Dean, my typist, offered her one day \
 To meet Pete Dean, a cousin. Jane's fianc\'e9 \
 Would then take all of them in his new car \
 A score of miles to a Hawaiian bar. \
 The boy was picked up at a quarter past \
390 Eight in New Wye. Sleet glazed the roads. At last \
 They found the place - when suddenly Pete Dean \
 Clutching his brow exclaimed that he had clean \
 Forgotten an appointment with a chum \
 Who'd land in jail if he, Pete, did not come, \
 Et cetera. She said she understood. \
 After he'd gone the three young people stood \
 Before the azure entrance for awhile. \
 Puddles were neon-barred; and with a smile \
 She said she'd be de trop, she'd much prefer \
400 Just going home. Her friends escorted her \
 To the bus stop and left; but she, instead \
 Of riding home, got off at Lochanhead. \
 \
 You scrutinized your wrist: "It's eight fifteen. \
 [And here time forked.] I'll turn it on." The screen \
 In its blank-broth evolved a lifelike blur, \
 And music welled. \
 He took one look at her,\
 And shot a death ray at well-meaning Jane.\
\
 A male hand traced from Florida to Maine \
 The curving arrows of Aeolian wars. \
410 You said that later a quartet of bores, \
 Two writers and two critics, would debate \
 The Cause of Poetry on Channel 8. \
 A nymph came pirouetting, under white \
 Rotating petals, in a vernal rite \
 To kneel before an altar in a wood \
 Where various articles of toilet stood. \
 I went upstairs and read a galley proof, \
 And heard the wind roll marbles on the roof. \
 "See the blind beggar dance, the cripple sing"\
420 Has unmistakably the vulgar ring \
 Of its preposterous age. Then came your call, \
 My tender mockingbird, up from the hall. \
 I was in time to overhear brief fame \
 And have a cup of tea with you: my name \
 Was mentioned twice, as usual just behind \
 (one oozy footstep) Frost. \
 "Sure you don't mind?\
 I'll catch the Exton plane, because you know\
 If I don't come by midnight with the dough -"\
 \
 And then there was a kind of travelog: \
430 A host narrator took us through the fog \
 Of a March night, where headlights from afar \
 Approached and grew like a dilating star, \
 To the green, indigo and tawny, sea \
 Which we had visited in thirty-three, \
 Nine months before her birth. Now it was all \
 Pepper-and-salt, and hardly could recall \
 That first long ramble, the relentless light, \
 The flock of sails (one blue among the white \
 Clashed queerly with the sea, and two were red), \
440 The man in the old blazer, crumbing bread, \
 The crowding gulls insufferably loud, \
 And one dark pigeon waddling in the crowd. \
 "Was that the phone?" You listened at the door. \
 More headlights in the fog. There was no sense\
 In window-rubbing: only some white fence\
 And the reflector poles passed by unmasked.\
 \
 "Are we quite sure she's acting right?" you asked. \
 "It's technically a blind date, of course. \
450 Well, shall we try the preview of Remorse?" \
 And we allowed, in all tranquillity, \
 The famous film to spread its charmed marquee; \
 The famous face flowed in, fair and inane: \
 The parted lips, the swimming eyes, the grain \
 Of beauty on the cheek, odd gallicism, \
 And the soft form dissolving in the prism \
 Of corporate desire. \
 "I think," she said,\
 "I'll get off here." "It's only Lochanhead."\
 "Yes, that's okay." Gripping the stang, she peered\
460 At ghostly trees. Bus stopped. Bus disappeared.\
 \
 Thunder above the Jungle. "No, not that!" \
 Pat Pink, our guest (antiatomic chat). \
 Eleven struck. You sighed. "Well, I'm afraid \
 There's nothing else of interest." You played \
 Network roulette: the dial turned and trk'ed. \
 Commercials were beheaded. Faces flicked. \
 An open mouth in midsong was struck out. \
 An imbecile with sideburns was about \
 To use his gun, but you were much too quick. \
470 A jovial Negro raised his trumpet. Trk. \
 Your ruby ring made life and laid the law. \
 Oh, switch it off! And as life snapped we saw \
 A pinhead light dwindle and die in black \
 Infinity. \
 Out of his lakeside shack\
 A watchman, Father Time, all gray and bent,\
 Emerged with his uneasy dog and went\
 Along the reedy bank. He came too late.\
 \
 You gently yawned and stacked away your plate. \
 We heard the wind. We heard it rush and throw \
480 Twigs at the windowpane. Phone ringing? No. \
 I helped you with the dishes. The tall clock \
 Kept on demolishing young root, old rock. \
 \
 "Midnight," you said. What's midnight to the young? \
 And suddenly a festive blaze was flung \
 Across five cedar trunks, snowpatches showed, \
 And a patrol car on our bumpy road \
 Came to a crunching stop. Retake, retake! \
 \
 People have thought she tried to cross the lake \
 At Lochan Neck where zesty skaters crossed \
490 From Exe to Wye on days of special frost. \
 Others supposed she might have lost her way \
 By turning left from Bridgeroad; and some say \
 She took her poor young life. I know. You know. \
 \
 It was a night of thaw, a night of blow, \
 With great excitement in the air. Black spring \
 Stood just around the corner, shivering \
 In the wet starlight and on the wet ground. \
 The lake lay in the mist, its ice half drowned. \
 A blurry shape stepped off the reedy bank \
500 Into a crackling, gulping swamp, and sank. \
Canto Three \
 \
 L'if, lifeless tree! Your great Maybe, Rabelais: \
 The grand potato. \
 I.P.H., a lay \
 Institute (I) of Preparation (P) \
 For the Hereafter (H), or If, as we \
 Called it - big if! - engaged me for one term \
 To speak on death ("to lecture on the Worm," \
 Wrote President McAber). \
 You and I, \
 And she, then a mere tot, moved from New Wye \
 To Yewshade, in another, higher state. \
510 I love great mountains. From the iron gate \
 Of the ramshackle house we rented there \
 One saw a snowy form, so far, so fair, \
 That one could only fetch a sigh, as if \
 It might assist assimilation. \
 Iph \
 Was a larvorium and a violet: \
 A grave in Reason's early spring. And yet \
 It missed the gist of the whole thing; it missed \
 What mostly interests the preterist; \
 For we die every day; oblivion thrives \
520 Not on dry thighbones but on blood-ripe lives, \
 And our best yesterdays are now foul piles \
 Of crumpled names, phone numbers and foxed files.\
 I'm ready to become a floweret \
 Or a fat fly, but never, to forget. \
 And I'll turn down eternity unless \
 The melancholy and the tenderness \
 Of mortal life; the passion and the pain; \
 The claret taillight of that dwindling plane \
 Off Hesperus; your gesture of dismay \
530 On running out of cigarettes; the way \
 You smile at dogs; the trail of silver slime \
 Snails leave on flagstones; this good ink, this rhyme,\
 This index card, this slender rubber band \
 Which always forms, when dropped, an ampersand, \
 Are found in Heaven by the newlydead \
 Stored in its strongholds through the years. \
 Instead \
 The Institute assumed it might be wise \
 Not to expect too much of paradise: \
 What if there's nobody to say hullo \
 To the newcomer, no reception, no \
540 Indoctrination? What if you are tossed \
 Into a boundless void, your bearings lost, \
 Your spirit stripped and utterly alone, \
 Your task unfinished, your despair unknown, \
 Your body just beginning to putresce, \
 A non-undresssable in morning dress, \
 Your widow lying prone on a dim bed, \
 Herself a blur in your dissolving head! \
 \
 While snubbing gods, including the big G, \
550 Iph borrowed some peripheral debris \
 From mystic visions; and it offered tips \
 (The amber spectacles for life's eclipse) - \
 How not to panic when you're made a ghost:, \
 Sidle and slide, choose a smooth surd, and coast, \
 Meet solid bodies and glissade right through, \
 Or let a person circulate through you. \
 How to locate in blackness, with a gasp, \
 Terra the Fair, an orbicle of jasp. \
 How to keep sane in spiral types of space. \
560 Precautions to be taken in the case \
 Of freak reincarnation: what to do \
 On suddenly discovering that you \
 Are now a young and vulnerable toad \
 Plump in the middle of a busy road, \
 Or a bear cub beneath a burning pine, \
 Or a book mite in a revived divine. \
 \
 Time means succession, and succession, change: \
 Hence timelessness is bound to disarrange \
 Schedules of sentiment. We give advice \
570 To widower. He has been married twice: \
 He meets his wives; both loved, both loving, both \
 Jealous of one another. Time means growth. \
 And growth means nothing in Elysian life. \
 Fondling a changeless child, the flax-haired wife \
 Grieves on the brink of a remembered pond \
 Full of a dreamy sky. And, also blond, \
 But with a touch of tawny in the shade, \
 Feet up, knees clasped, on a stone balustrade \
 The other sits and raises a moist gaze \
580 Toward the blue impenetrable haze. \
 How to begin? Which first to kiss? What toy \
 To give the babe? Does that small solemn boy \
 Know of the head-on crash which on a wild \
 March night killed both the mother and the child? \
 And she, the second love, with instep bare \
 In ballerina black, why does she wear \
 The earrings from the other's jewel case? \
 And why does she avert her fierce young face? \
 \
 For as we know from dreams it is so hard \
590 To speak to our dear dead! They disregard \
 Our apprehension, queaziness and shame - \
 The awful sense that they're not quite the same. \
 And our school chum killed in a distant war \
 Is not surprised to see us at his door. \
 And in a blend of jauntiness and gloom \
 Points at the puddles in his basement room. \
 \
 But who can teach the thoughts we should roll-call \
 When morning finds us marching to the wall \
 Under the stage direction of some goon \
600 Political, some uniformed baboon? \
 We'll think of matters only known to us - \
 Empires of rhyme, Indies of calculus; \
 Listen to distant cocks crow, and discern \
 Upon the rough gray wall a rare wall fern; \
 And while our royal hands are being tied, \
 Taunt our inferiors, cheerfully deride \
 The dedicated imbeciles, and spit \
 Into their eyes just for the fun of it. \
 \
 Nor can one help the exile, the old man \
610 Dying in a motel, with the loud fan \
 Revolving in the torrid prairie night \
 And, from the outside, bits of colored light \
 Reaching his bed like dark hands from the past \
 He suffocates and conjures in two tongues \
 The nebulae dilating in his lungs. \
 \
 A wrench, a rift - that's all one can foresee. \
 Maybe one finds le grand n\'e9ant; maybe \
 Again one spirals from the tuber's eye. \
 \
620 As you remarked the last time we went by \
 The Institute: "I really could not tell \
 The differences between this place and Hell." \
 \
 We heard cremationists guffaw and snort \
 At Grabermann's denouncing the Retort \
 As detrimental to the birth of wraiths. \
 We all avoided criticizing faiths. \
 The great Starover Blue reviewed the role \
 Planets had played as landfalls of the soul. \
 The fate of beasts was pondered. A Chinese \
630 Discanted on the etiquette at teas \
 With ancestors, and how far up to go. \
 I tore apart the fantasies of Poe, \
 And dealt with childhood memories of strange \
 Nacreous gleams beyond the adults' range. \
 Among our auditors were a young priest \
 And an old Communist. Iph could at least \
 Compete with churches and the party line. \
 \
 In later years it started to decline: \
 Buddhism took root. A medium smuggled in \
640 Pale jellies and a floating mandolin. \
 Fra Karamazov, mumbling his inept \
 All is allowed, into some classes crept; \
 And to fulfill the fish wish of the womb, \
 A school of Freudians headed for the tomb. \
 \
 That tasteless venture helped me in a way. \
 I learnt what to ignore in my survey \
 Of death's abyss. And when we lost our child \
 I knew there would be nothing: no self-styled \
 Spirit would touch a keyboard of dry wood \
650 To rap out her pet name; no phantom would \
 Rise gracefully to welcome you and me \
 In the dark garden, near the shagbark tree. \
 \
 "What is that funny creaking - do you hear?" \
 "It is the shutter on the stairs, my dear." \
 \
 "If you're not sleeping, let's turn on the light. \
 I hate that wind! Let's play some chess." "All right." \
 \
 "I'm sure it's not the shutter. There - again." \
 "It is a tendril fingering the pane." \
 \
 "What glided down the roof and made that thud?" \
660 "It is old winter tumbling in the mud." \
 \
 "And now what shall I do? My knight is pinned." \
 \
 Who rides so late in the night and the wind? \
 It is the writer's grief. It is the wild \
 March wind. It is the father with his child. \
 \
 Later came minutes, hours, whole days at last, \
 when she'd be absent from our thoughts, so fast \
 Did life, the woolly caterpillar run. \
 We went to Italy. Sprawled in the sun. \
 On a white beach with other pink or brown \
670 Americans. Flew back to our small town. \
 Found that my bunch of essays The Untamed\
 Seahorse was "universally acclaimed" \
 (It sold three hundred copies in one year). \
 Again school started, and on hillsides, where \
 Wound distant roads, one saw the steady stream \
 Of carlights all returning to the dream \
 Of college education. You went on \
 Translating into French Marvell and Donne. \
 It was a year of Tempests: Hurricane \
680 Lolita Swept from Florida to Maine. \
 Mars glowed. Shahs married. Gloomy Russians spied.\
 Lang made your portrait. And one night I died. \
 \
 The Crashaw Club had paid me to discuss \
 Why Poetry Is Meaningful to Us. \
 I gave my sermon, a dull thing but short. \
 As I was leaving in some haste, to thwart \
 The so-called "question period" at the end, \
 One of those peevish people who attend \
 Such talks only to say they disagree \
690 Stood up and pointed with his pipe at me. \
 \
 And then it happened - the attack, the trance, \
 Or one of my old fits. There sat by chance \
 A doctor in the front row. At his feet \
 Patly I fell. My heart had stopped to beat, \
 It seems, and several moments passed before \
 It heaved and went on trudging to a more \
 Conclusive destination. Give me now \
 Your full attention. \
 \
 I can't tell you how \
 I knew - but I did know that I had crossed \
700 The border. Everything I loved was lost \
 But no aorta could report regret. \
 A sun of rubber was convulsed and set; \
 And blood-black nothingness began to spin \
 A system of cells interlinked within \
 Cells interlinked within cells interlinked \
 Within one stem. And dreadfully distinct \
 Against the dark, a tall white fountain played. \
 \
 I realized, of course, that it was made \
 Not of our atoms; that the sense behind\
710 The scene was not our sense. In life, the mind \
 Of any man is quick to recognize \
 Natural shams, and then before his eyes \
 The reed becomes a bird, the knobby twig \
 An inchworm, and the cobra head, a big \
 Wickedly folded moth. But in the case \
 Of my white fountain what it did replace \
 Perceptually was something that, I felt, \
 Could be grasped only by whoever dwelt \
 In the strange world where I was a mere stray. \
 \
720 And presently I saw it melt away: \
 Though still unconscious I was back on earth. \
 The tale I told provoked my doctor's mirth. \
 He doubted very much that in the state \
 He found me in "one could hallucinate \
 Or dream in any sense. Later, perhaps, \
 But not during the actual collapse. \
 No, Mr. Shade." \
 But, Doctor, I was dead! \
 He smiled. "Not quite: just half a shade," he said. \
 \
 However, I demurred. In mind I kept \
 Replaying the whole thing. Again I stepped \
730 Down from the platform, and felt strange and hot, \
 And saw that chap stand up, and toppled, not \
 Because a heckler pointed with his pipe, \
 But probably because the time was ripe \
 For just that bump and wobble on the part \
 Of a limp blimp, an old unstable heart. \
 \
 My vision reeked with truth. It had the tone, \
 The quiddity and quaintness of its own \
 Reality. It was. As time went on. \
740 Its constant vertical in triumph shone. \
 Often when troubled by the outer glare \
 Of street and strife, inward I'd turn, and there, \
 There in the background of my soul it stood, \
 Old Faithful! And its presence always would \
 Console me wonderfully. Then, one day, \
 I came across what seemed a twin display. \
 \
 It was a story in a magazine \
 About a Mrs. Z. whose heart had been \
 Rubbed back to life by a prompt surgeon's hand. \
750 She told her interviewer of "The Land \
 Beyond the Veil" and the account contained \
 A hint of angels, and a glint of stained \
 Windows, and some soft music, and a choice \
 Of hymnal items, and her mother's voice; \
 But at the end she mentioned a remote \
 Landscape, a hazy orchard - and I quote: \
 "Beyond that orchard through a kind of smoke \
 I glimpsed a tall white fountain - and awoke." \
 \
 If on some nameless island Captain Schmidt \
760 Sees a new animal and captures it, \
 And if, a little later, Captain Smith \
 Brings back a skin, that island is no myth. \
 Our fountain was a signpost and a mark \
 Objectively enduring in the dark, \
 Strong as a bone, substantial as a tooth, \
 And almost vulgar in its robust truth! \
 \
 The article was by Jim Coates. To Jim \
 Forthwith I wrote. Got her address from him. \
 Drove west three hundred miles to talk to her. \
770 Arrived. Was met by an impassioned purr. \
 Saw that blue hair, those freckled hands, that rapt \
 Orchideous air - and knew that I was trapped. \
 \
 "Who'd miss the opportunity to meet \
 A poet so distinguished?" It was sweet \
 Of me to come! I desperately tried \
 To ask my questions. They were brushed aside: \
 "Perhaps some other time." The journalist \
 Still had her scribblings. I should not insist. \
 She plied me with fruit cake, turning it all \
780 Into an idiotic social call. \
 "I can't believe," she said, "that it is you!\
 I loved your poem in the Blue Review. \
 That one about Mon Blon. I have a niece \
 Who's climbed the Matterhorn. The other piece \
 I could not understand. I mean the sense. \
 Because, of course, the sound - But I'm so dense!" \
 \
 She was. I might have persevered. I might \
 Have made her tell me more about the white \
 Fountain we both had seen "beyond the veil" \
790 But if (I thought) I mentioned that detail \
 She'd pounce upon it. as upon a fond \
 Affinity, a sacramental bond, \
 Uniting mystically her and me, \
 And in a jiffy our two souls would be \
 Brother and sister trembling on the brink \
 Of tender incest. "Well," I said, "I think \
 It's getting late..." \
 I also called on Coates. \
 He was afraid he had mislaid her notes. \
 He took his article from a steel file: - \
800 "It's accurate. I have not changed her style. \
 There's one misprint - not that it matters much: \
 Mountain, not fountain. The majestic touch." \
 \
 Life Everlasting - based on a misprint! \
 I mused as I drove homeward: take the hint, \
 And stop investigating my abyss? \
 But all at once it dawned on me that this\
 Was the real point, the contrapuntal theme; \
 Just this: not text, but texture; not the dream \
 But a topsy-turvical coincidence, \
810 Not flimsy nonsense, but a web of sense. \
 Yes! It sufficed that I in life could find \
 Some kind of link-and-bobolink, some kind \
 Of correlated pattern in the game, \
 Plexed artistry, and something of the same \
 Pleasure in it as they who played it found. \
 \
 It did not matter who they were. No sound, \
 No furtive light came from their involute \
 Abode, but there they were, aloof and mute, \
 Playing a game of worlds, promoting pawns \
820 To ivory unicorns and ebon fauns; \
 Kindling a long life here, extinguishing \
 A short one there; killing a Balkan king; \
 Causing a chunk of ice formed on a high- \
 Flying airplane to plummet from the sky \
 And strike a farmer dead; hiding my keys, \
 Glasses or pipe. Coordinating these \
 Events and objects with remote events \
 And vanished objects. Making ornaments \
 Of accidents and possibilities. \
 \
830 Stormcoated, I strode in: Sybil, it is \
 My firm conviction - "Darling, shut the door. \
 Had a nice trip?" Splendid - but what is more \
 I have returned convinced that I can grope \
 My way to some - to some - "Yes, dear?" Faint hope.\
Canto Four \
 \
 Now I shall spy on beauty as none has \
 Spied on it yet. Now I shall cry out as \
 None has cried out. Now I shall try what none \
 Has tried. Now I shall do what none has done. \
 And speaking of this wonderful machine: \
840 I'm puzzled by the difference between \
 Two methods of composing: A, the kind \
 Which goes on solely in the poet's mind, \
 A testing of performing words, while he \
 Is soaping a third time one leg, and B, \
 The other kind, much more decorous, when http://www.en8848.com.cn/
\f1 \'a1\'ba\'d4\'ad\'b0\'e6\'d3\'a2\'d3\'ef\'a1\'bb
\f0 \
 He's in his study writing with a pen. \
 \
 In method B the hand supports the thought, \
 The abstract battle is concretely fought. \
 The pen stops in mid-air, then swoops to bar \
850 A canceled sunset or restore a star, \
 And thus it physically guides the phrase \
 Toward faint daylight through the inky maze. \
 \
 But method A is agony! The brain \
 Is soon enclosed in a steel cap of pain. \
 A muse in overalls directs the drill \
 Which grinds and which no effort of the will \
 Can interrupt, while the automaton \
 Is taking off what he has just put on \
 Or walking briskly to the corner store \
860 To buy the paper he has read before. \
 \
 Why is it so? Is it, perhaps, because \
 In penless work there is no pen-poised pause \
 And one must use three hands at the same time, \
 Having to choose the necessary rhyme, \
 Hold the completed line before one's eyes, \
 And keep in mind all the preceding tries? \
 Or is the process deeper with no desk http://www.en8848.com.cn/
\f1 \'a1\'ba\'d4\'ad\'b0\'e6\'d3\'a2\'d3\'ef\'a1\'bb
\f0 \
 To prop the false and hoist the poetesque? \
 For there are those mysterious moments when \
870 Too weary to delete, I drop my pen; \
 I ambulate - and by some mute command \
 The right word flutes and perches on my hand. \
 \
 My best time is the morning; my preferred \
 Season, midsummer. I once overheard. \
 Myself awakening while half of me \
 Still slept in bed. I tore my spirit free, \
 And caught up with myself - upon the lawn \
 Where clover leaves cupped the topaz of dawn, \
 And where Shade stood in nightshirt and one shoe. \
880 And then I realized that this half too \
 Was fast asleep; both laughed and I awoke \
 Safe in my bed as day its eggshell broke, \
 And robins walked and stopped, and on the damp \
 Gemmed turf a brown shoe lay! My secret stamp, \
 The Shade impress, the mystery inborn. \
 Mirages, miracles, midsummer morn. \
 Since my biographer may be too staid \
 Or know too little to affirm that Shade \
 Shaved in his bath, here goes: \
 "He'd fixed a sort http://www.en8848.com.cn/
\f1 \'a1\'ba\'d4\'ad\'b0\'e6\'d3\'a2\'d3\'ef\'a1\'bb
\f0 \
890 Of hinge-and-screw affair, a steel support \
 Running across the tub to hold in place \
 The shaving mirror right before his face \
 And with his toe renewing tap-warmth, he'd \
 Sit like a king there, and like Marat bleed." \
 \
 The more I weigh, the less secure my skin; \
 In places it's ridiculously thin; \
 Thus near the mouth: the space between its wick \
 And my grimace, invites the wicked nick. \
 Or this dewlap: some day I must set free \
900 The Newport Frill inveterate in me. \
 My Adam's apple is a prickly pear: \
 Now I shall speak of evil and despair\
 As none has spoken. Five, six, seven, eight, \
 Nine strokes are not enough. Ten. I palpate \
 Through strawberry-and-cream the gory mess \
 And find unchanged that patch of prickliness. \
 \
 I have my doubts about the one-armed bloke \
 Who in commercials with one gliding stroke \
 Clears a smooth path of flesh from ear to chin, \
910 Then wipes his face and fondly tries his skin. \
 I'm in the class of fussy bimanists. \
 As a discreet ephebe in tights assists http://www.en8848.com.cn/
\f1 \'a1\'ba\'d4\'ad\'b0\'e6\'d3\'a2\'d3\'ef\'a1\'bb
\f0 \
 A female in an acrobatic dance, \
 My left hand helps, and holds, and shifts its stance. \
 \
 Now I shall speak... Better than any soap \
 Is the sensation for which poets hope \
 When inspiration and its icy blaze, \
 The sudden image, the immediate phrase \
 Over the skin a triple ripple send \
920 Making the little hairs all stand on end \
 As in the enlarged animated scheme \
 Of whiskers mowed when held up by Our Cream. \
 \
 Now I shall speak of evil as none has \
 Spoken before. I loathe such things as jazz; \
 The white-hosed moron torturing a black \
 Bull, rayed with red; abstractist bric-a-brac; \
 Primitivist folk-masks; progressive schools; \
 Music in supermarkets; swimming pools; \
 Brutes, bores, class-conscious Philistines, Freud, Marx,\
930 Fake thinkers, puffed-up poets, frauds and sharks. \
 \
 And while the safety blade with scrape and screak \
 Travels across the country of my cheek; \
 Cars on the highway pass, and up the steep \
 Incline big trucks around my jawbone creep, \
 And now a silent liner docks, and now \
 Sunglassers tour Beirut, and now I plough \
 Old Zembla's fields where my gay stubble grows, \
 And slaves make hay between my mouth and nose. \
 \
 Man's life as commentary to abstruse\
940 Unfinished poem. Note for further use. \
 \
 Dressing in all the rooms, I rhyme and roam \
 Throughout the house with, in my fist, a comb \
 Or a shoehorn, which turns into the spoon \
 I eat my egg with. In the afternoon \
 You drive me to the library. We dine \
 At half past six. And that odd muse of mine, \
 My versipel, is with me everywhere, \
 In carrel and in car, and in my chair. \
 \
 And all the time, and all the time, my love, \
950 You too are there, beneath the word, above \
 The syllable, to underscore and stress \
 The vital rhythm. One heard a woman's dress \
 Rustle in days of yore. I've often caught \
 The sound and sense of your approaching thought. \
 And all in you is youth, and you make new, \
 By quoting them, old things I made for you. \
 \
 Dim Gulf was my first book (free verse); Night Rote\
 Came next; then Hebe's Cup, my final float \
 In that damp carnival, for now I term \
960 Everything "Poems," and no longer squirm. \
 (But this transparent thingum does require \
 Some moondrop title. Help me, Will! Pale Fire.) \
 \
 Gently the day has passed in a sustained \
 Low hum of harmony. The brain is drained \
 And a brown ament, and the noun I meant \
 To use but did not, dry on the cement. \
 Maybe my sensual love for the consonne\
 D'appui, Echo's fey child, is based upon \
 A feeling of fantastically planned, \
970 Richly rhymed life. \
 I feel I understand \
 Existence, or at least a minute part \
 Of my existence, only through my art, \
 In terms of combinational delight; \
 And if my private universe scans right, \
 So does the verse of galaxies divine \
 Which I suspect is an iambic line. \
 I'm reasonably sure that we survive \
 And that my darling somewhere is alive, \
 As I am reasonably sure that I \
980 Shall wake at six tomorrow, on July \
 The twenty-second, nineteen fifty-nine, \
 And that the day will probably be fine; \
 So this alarm clock let me set myself, \
 Yawn, and put back Shade's "Poems" on their shelf. \
 \
 But it's not bedtime yet. The sun attains \
 Old Dr. Sutton's last two windowpanes. \
 The man must be - what? Eighty? Eighty-two? \
 Was twice my age the year I married you. \
 Where are you? In the garden. I can see \
990 Part of your shadow near the shagbark tree. \
 Somewhere horseshoes are being tossed. Click, Clunk.\
 (Leaning against its lamppost like a drunk.) \
 A dark Vanessa with crimson band \
 Wheels in the low sun, settles on the sand \
 And shows its ink-blue wingtips flecked with white. \
 And through the flowing shade and ebbing light \
 A man, unheedful of the butterfly - \
 Some neighbor's gardener, I guess - goes by \
 Trundling an empty barrow up the lane. }
