        and let your breath be moist against me
        like bright beads on yellow globes

        telephone the power-house
        that the main wires are insulate

        (her words play softly up and down
        dewy corridors of billboards)

        then with your tongue remove the tape
        and press your lips to mine
        till they are incandescent
